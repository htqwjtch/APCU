2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell EO_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) EO_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Y0_reg_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Y0_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Y1_reg_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Y1_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch EO_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin EO_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch GS_reg/L7 (in GS_reg macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin GS_reg/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Y0_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Y0_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Y1_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Y1_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Y2_reg/L7 (in Y2_reg macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Y2_reg/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
